# CoreJobs
This plugin was created for all. Anyone can modify them and make a PR. Thanks for using them.

Note: This plugin now is very very pointless and basic. Just for be.

I'm planning add:
- Database SQLITE Async.
- More Costumisable Job.
- More Jobs.
- Job Level
- Job Skills.
- BossBar when you use a job.
- Experience System.
- MultiLanguage Support (Messages + API for custom plugins for their Core).
